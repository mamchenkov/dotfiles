# This is a filter script that takes input from
# the STDIN, transforms it, and pipes to STDOUT.
#
# The transformation is a replacement of the
# basic ASCII characters (dash, plus, pipe, etc),
# used to draw tables, into something a little
# bit more fancy.
#
# One particularly useful application of this is
# for paging MySQL output.
